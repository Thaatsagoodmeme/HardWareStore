## Current situation:
The initial meeting with the client has been conducted and enough information has been gathered in order to create the project plan. 
The client is a representative for Media Bazaar, which specializes in selling all kinds of electronic equipment - personal computers, computer accessories, gadgets, cameras, etc..With such a variety of products comes the responsibility of tracking each one of them. On a large scale store like this, a few dozen employees need to be hired to keep everything on track. One needs to keep track of the employees as well. Media Bazaar, nevertheless, has no solution for employee & stock management and has contacted CVSK Solutions for help.
After the upcoming meeting with the project manager, the project plan will be further polished and finished.

## Problem description:
Our client faces problems with keeping everything on track. That is, employees and stock management. Employee management has a higher priority over stock management currently. 
Employees should be able to see a personal schedule with their shifts and sales department managers should be responsible for managing these schedules. The Human Resources department should have the ability to hire and fire employees and manage their personal information and contracts.

## Project goal:
The goal of this project is to provide an administration system for Media Bazaar that will help solve its problems. The end product would be called MB Accounting.

## Deliverables:
The products that will be delivered to the client are as follows:
* Administration system software with features based on the client’s requirements
* Website regarding the software
* A presentation in which the features of our application will be shown and explained
* URS(User Requirements Specifications) document

## Non-deliverables:
Currently there are no non-deliverables.

## Constraints:
Expected work effort per person is about 16 hour per week - 64 hours per week or 320 in total for the whole software solution. However, depending on the time our team will spend on the software itself, a website might be excluded from the deliverables list. The end deadline for the software system is 20 March, 2021. C# .NET Framework v4.7 will be used to develop the software, in addition with MySQL Database to store all necessary information
GIT will be used as a version control system, so everything can be kept on track. All participants in this project(that is, the client, the project manager and the developers) have access to the project on GitLab: https://git.fhict.nl/I450168/hardware-store
